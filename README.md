# cat_animated_chatbot_for_institution-

this project is the updated one 
i already done the same project a year ago 
now i just add transformers in this code and little updated.....
 
the overview:
 An animated cat that moves randomly around the screen.
 A chatbox that opens when clicking the cat.

The cat moves randomly around the page every 3 seconds.
Clicking the cat opens a floating chat window.
Users can type a message, and the bot replies with a fun message (You can later integrate an AI API).
Clicking the close button (âœ–) hides the chatbox.

 When a user sends a message, the chatbot calls the API (http://localhost:5000/chat).
 The API processes the question, finds the best answer from your ML model, and returns it.
 The chat window displays the response in the chatbox.

if you want detailed check my other one, ive mentioned there detailly.
